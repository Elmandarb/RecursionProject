THIS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTS 4 FUNCTIONS ITERATIVELY AND RECURSIVELY
THE FIRST FUNCTION COUNTS THE NUMBER OF INVERSIONS IN A VECTOR,
THE SECOND FUNCTION CREATES A VECTOR COMPRISED OF THE CLOSEST LARGEST
VALUE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF EVERY VALUE IN THE ORIGINAL VECTOR,
THE THIRD FUNCTION CREATES A VECTOR COMPRISED OF THE CLOSEST VALUE
THAT IS LARGER THAN THE TARGET VALUE ON THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT OF IT
THE FOURTH FUNCTION RETURNS THE LONGEST SUBSEQUENT RUN OF INCREASING
